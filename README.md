# Article Recommendations With IBM

I guess you have already several types of recommendations engines around you: movies recommendations by Netflix, product recommendations by Amazon, and so on so forth. What if we could predict whether a user would enjoy reading a certain article? That is precisely the main goal of this project: using data provided by IBM we would be exploring how to recommend articles from IBM Watson to users.
